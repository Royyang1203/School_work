            Master, International Master, Bachelor, and International Bachelor with 71 faculty members and 1,882 students in total. Facing the rapid development of globalization, in order to differentiate itself from those with the original credit system,
            the College has been working on incorporating teaching resources from all departments into creating a more flexible, forward-looking, and integrated program system. In light of that, each and every college- and dept.-level program is complete
            as well as independent, and beneficial to systemize teaching and professionalize learning. The program-based system is able to not only integrate teaching resources to make courses more specialized, but also give students an opportunity to
            choose the second professional program. With help from diversified courses, students can incorporate, even refine, more easily knowledge of their second specialty or sub-specialty into their major to reinforce their competitiveness when seeking
            employment.
