// Description

// n~n  blanks have been robbed this find day. ~m~ m  (greater than or equal to ~n n) police cruisers are on duty at various locations in the city. ~n~ n  of the cruisers should be dispatched, one to each of the banks, so as to minimize the average time of arrival at the ~n~ n  banks.

// Input
// The input file contains several sets of inputs. The description of each set is given below:

// The first line of input contains ~0 &lt; n \le m \le 20 0<n≤m≤20.
// n~n  lines follow, each containing ~m~ m  positive real numbers: the travel time for cruiser ~m~ m  to reach bank ~n n.
// Input is terminated by a case where ~m=n=0 m=n=0. This case should not be processed.

// Output
// For each set of input output a single number: the minimum average travel time, accurate to 2 fractional digits.

// Sample Input 1

// 3 4
// 10.0 23.0 30.0 40.0
// 5.0 20.0 10.0 60.0
// 18.0 20.0 20.0 30.0
// 0 0
// Sample Output 1

// 13.33
